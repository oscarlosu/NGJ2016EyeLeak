# Traingers
"Traingers" is a game about encounters with strangers on a train. The theme inspired us to focus on leaks of emotion and information from strangers through eye contact. Using an eyetracker the player looks at aliens to elicit their personal stories. Aliens that the player doesn't listen to leave and new ones appear while a musician plays music to suit each of their moods.

The aliens' stories were provided by other participants at the jam who we recorded.
